This document provides a comprehensive checklist to complete the ARM64 porting process based on the instructions in `ARM64_AUTOMATION_SUMMARY.md`.

## Overview

The ARM64 porting infrastructure is in place and verified. This checklist guides you through the remaining steps to complete the porting and validation process.

## Prerequisites

- [x] ARM64 self-hosted GitHub runner configured
- [x] ARM64 infrastructure setup complete
- [x] All workflows deployed and validated
- [x] Documentation created
- [x] Verification scripts passing

## Completion Steps

### Phase 1: Workflow Execution ⏳

- [ ] **1.1 Trigger ARM64 Complete Port Workflow**
  
  **On ARM64 system or via GitHub Actions:**
  ```bash
  gh workflow run arm64-complete-port.yml \
    -f run_full_pipeline=true \
    -f run_validation_tests=true
  ```
  
  **Or use the helper script:**
  ```bash
  ./continue_arm64_port.sh
  # Select option 'f' to trigger workflow
  ```
  
  **Or manually via GitHub web interface:**
  - Go to: https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/generative-protein-binder-design/actions
  - Click "ARM64 Complete Porting Workflow"
  - Click "Run workflow"
  - Enable both options and run

- [ ] **1.2 Monitor Workflow Progress**
  
  **Check status:**
  ```bash
  # List recent runs
  gh run list --workflow=arm64-complete-port.yml --limit 5
  
  # Watch live progress
  gh run watch
  
  # Or check runner status
  ./check_runner_status.sh
  ```
  
  **Via web interface:**
  - Visit: https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/generative-protein-binder-design/actions
  - Check latest "ARM64 Complete Porting Workflow" run
  - Monitor each job's progress

- [ ] **1.3 Verify All Jobs Complete Successfully**
  
  **Expected jobs (all should pass):**
  - ✓ ARM64 Platform Detection
  - ✓ Validate ARM64 Setup
  - ✓ Test Python Environment on ARM64
  - ✓ Test Docker Containers on ARM64
  - ✓ Test Native ARM64 Installation (or skipped)
  - ✓ Run Protein Design Pipeline (or skipped)
  - ✓ ARM64 Porting Completion Summary
  
  **Estimated completion time:** 15-40 minutes

### Phase 2: Results Validation ⏭️

- [ ] **2.1 Download Completion Report**
  
  ```bash
  # List available runs
  gh run list --workflow=arm64-complete-port.yml
  
  # Download completion report
  gh run download <run-id> --name arm64-completion-report-<run_number>
  
  # View the report
  cat arm64_completion_report.txt
  ```

- [ ] **2.2 Verify Completion Report Contents**
  
  **Check that the report shows:**
  - ✓ Platform: ARM64 (aarch64)
  - ✓ All validation tests passed
  - ✓ Python packages work on ARM64
  - ✓ Docker native containers functional
  - ✓ Docker AMD64 emulation functional
  - ✓ GPU accessible (if applicable)
  - ✓ Pipeline components operational

- [ ] **2.3 Download Pipeline Test Artifacts (if available)**
  
  ```bash
  # Download pipeline test results
  gh run download <run-id> --name arm64-pipeline-test-<run_number>
  
  # Review test outputs
  ls -la arm64_pipeline_test_*/
  ```

- [ ] **2.4 Review Workflow Logs for Any Warnings**
  
  ```bash
  # View detailed logs
  gh run view <run-id> --log
  
  # Or check specific job
  gh run view <run-id> --log --job <job-id>
  ```

### Phase 3: Full Pipeline Testing ⏭️

- [ ] **3.1 Test with Sample Protein Target**
  
  ```bash
  # Run pipeline with a known PDB target
  gh workflow run protein-design-pipeline.yml \
    -f use_native=true \
    -f target_protein=7BZ5 \
    -f num_designs=10
  ```

- [ ] **3.2 Monitor Pipeline Execution**
  
  ```bash
  # Watch pipeline progress
  gh run watch
  
  # Check for errors
  gh run view <run-id> --log
  ```

- [ ] **3.3 Validate Pipeline Outputs**
  
  **Check that pipeline produces:**
  - ✓ Binder designs generated
  - ✓ Structural predictions created
  - ✓ Analysis results available
  - ✓ No critical errors in logs

- [ ] **3.4 Benchmark Performance (Optional)**
  
  ```bash
  # Compare ARM64 vs AMD64 performance
  # Document execution times
  # Note resource utilization
  ```

### Phase 4: Production Deployment ⏭️

- [ ] **4.1 Review Deployment Options**
  
  Read `ARM64_DEPLOYMENT.md` and choose deployment strategy:
  - Option A: Docker Compose with AMD64 emulation
  - Option B: Native ARM64 installation
  - Option C: Hybrid approach

- [ ] **4.2 Configure Production Environment**
  
  ```bash
  # Set NGC API key
  export NGC_CLI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  
  # Configure environment variables
  # Set up persistent storage
  # Configure GPU access
  ```

- [ ] **4.3 Deploy Services**
  
  **For Docker Compose deployment:**
  ```bash
  cd deploy
  docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
  
  # Verify services are running
  docker compose ps
  ```
  
  **For native installation:**
  ```bash
  # Follow ARM64_NATIVE_INSTALLATION.md
  # Set up conda/mamba environment
  # Install ARM64-native packages
  ```

- [ ] **4.4 Verify Production Deployment**
  
  ```bash
  # Test services are accessible
  # Run health checks
  ./check_runner_status.sh
  
  # Test with small workload
  gh workflow run system-health.yml -f deep_check=true
  ```

- [ ] **4.5 Set Up Monitoring**

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Doesn't Start

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify runner is online
./check_runner_status.sh

# Check workflow syntax
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/arm64-complete-port.yml'))"

# Verify branch
git branch
```

### Jobs Fail

**Actions:**
1. Review job logs in GitHub Actions
2. Check runner resources (memory, disk)
3. Verify NGC API keys (for NIM containers)
4. Check GPU driver status
5. Review ARM64_DEPLOYMENT.md for troubleshooting

### Performance Issues

**Optimize:**
- Use native ARM64 packages where possible
- Limit AMD64 emulation to required services only
- Adjust resource allocations
- Monitor and tune based on workload
