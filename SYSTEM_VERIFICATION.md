System: Linux (bash shell)

## Hardware Requirements Check

### ✅ Storage
- **Required**: 1.3TB NVMe SSD space
- **Available**: 3.3TB 
- **Status**: ✅ PASS - Sufficient space available

### ⚠️ CPU
- **Required**: 24+ CPU cores
- **Available**: 20 cores
- **Status**: ⚠️ CAUTION - May experience performance degradation

### ✅ RAM
- **Required**: 64GB
- **Available**: 120GB
- **Status**: ✅ PASS - Excellent memory capacity

### ⚠️ GPU
- **Required**: 2+ NVIDIA L40s, A100, or H100 GPUs
- **Available**: 1x NVIDIA GB10
- **Status**: ⚠️ CAUTION - Limited GPU resources may affect workflow performance

## Software Requirements Check

- **Version**: 28.3.3
- **Compose**: v2.39.1
- **Status**: ✅ PASS - Modern Docker installation

### ✅ NVIDIA Support
- **Driver**: 580.95.05
- **CUDA**: 13.0
- **Container Runtime**: 1.17.9
- **Status**: ✅ PASS - Full NVIDIA stack available

### ✅ Python
- **Version**: 3.12.3
- **Environment**: Virtual environment configured

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Set up NGC API Key** - Required for downloading NIM containers
2. **Configure NIM cache directory** - For model storage and faster restarts

### Performance Optimization Suggestions
1. **GPU Limitation**: With only 1 GPU available, consider:
   - Running fewer services simultaneously
   - Modifying docker-compose.yaml to share GPU resources
   - Expecting longer processing times

2. **CPU Limitation**: With 20 cores (vs 24 recommended):
   - Monitor CPU usage during intensive operations
   - Consider closing unnecessary applications during processing

### Potential Issues to Monitor
1. **Single GPU Bottleneck**: The workflow is designed for 4 GPUs (one per service)
   - AlphaFold2, RFDiffusion, ProteinMPNN, and AlphaFold2-Multimer each expect dedicated GPU
   - May need to run services sequentially rather than in parallel

2. **Model Download Time**: Expect 3-7 hours for initial setup
   - Ensure stable internet connection
   - Monitor disk space during download

## Next Steps

1. Run the setup script: `./setup_local.sh`
2. Follow prompts to configure NGC API key
3. Start Docker services: `cd deploy && docker compose up`
4. Monitor initial model downloads
5. Test notebook functionality: `cd src && jupyter notebook`

## Alternative Configurations

If performance issues arise due to limited GPU resources:

1. **Sequential Processing**: Modify workflow to process steps one at a time
2. **Cloud Deployment**: Consider using cloud instances with adequate GPU resources
3. **Reduced Workload**: Start with smaller examples (like 1R42) before attempting larger ones

## System Readiness Score: 75/100

**Breakdown:**
- Storage: 25/25 ✅
- RAM: 25/25 ✅  
- Software: 25/25 ✅
- CPU: 15/25 ⚠️ (20/24 cores)
- GPU: 10/25 ⚠️ (1/2+ GPUs)

**Overall**: System is functional but may experience performance limitations. Suitable for learning and small-scale experiments.
