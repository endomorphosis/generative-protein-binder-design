# mcp-dashboard-real (Deprecated)

This directory is a legacy/alternate dashboard prototype.

## Status

- **Deprecated**: use [mcp-dashboard/](../mcp-dashboard) as the canonical dashboard.
- New work (UI features, the shared JS SDK integration, Playwright E2E, and CI alignment) happens only in `mcp-dashboard/`.

## Why it still exists

It’s kept for reference while the project converges on a single dashboard implementation.
If you don’t need it, it can be removed in a future cleanup.
