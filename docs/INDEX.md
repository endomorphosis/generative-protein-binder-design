# Documentation Index

This repo has accumulated a lot of platform-specific work (AMD64 NIM stacks, ARM64 host-native services, GPU/MMseqs2 optimizations, etc.).

Use this page as the *canonical* entrypoint to find the right guide.

## Getting started (most people)

- **Fastest path to a working UI**: [../START_HERE.md](../START_HERE.md)
- **Quick start (terminal-first)**: [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md)
- **Docker + stacks overview**: [DOCKER_MCP_README.md](DOCKER_MCP_README.md)

## For agents / contributors

- **How to interact with the codebase deterministically**: [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)
- **Repo architecture / mental model**: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)

## Platform & performance

- **AlphaFold inference optimizations**: [ALPHAFOLD_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md](ALPHAFOLD_OPTIMIZATION_GUIDE.md)
- **MMseqs2 GPU quickstart**: [MMSEQS2_GPU_QUICKSTART.md](MMSEQS2_GPU_QUICKSTART.md)

## "What changed" / deep institutional context

These documents are valuable, but are often historical narratives rather than step-by-step onboarding:

- [../INSTITUTIONAL_KNOWLEDGE.md](../INSTITUTIONAL_KNOWLEDGE.md)
- [../INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md](../INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md)
- [../ZERO_TOUCH_GPU_COMPLETE.md](../ZERO_TOUCH_GPU_COMPLETE.md)
