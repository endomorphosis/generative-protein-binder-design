## 🎯 **How to Use Your ARM64 CI/CD Pipeline**

### **Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)**
1. Visit: https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/generative-protein-binder-design/actions
2. Select any workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Configure parameters
5. Watch it execute on your ARM64 runner! 🚀

### **Method 2: Git Push Triggers**
```bash
# Make any change and push to trigger workflows
echo "Test $(date)" >> test_trigger.txt
git add test_trigger.txt
git commit -m "Trigger ARM64 workflows"
git push origin HEAD
```

### **Method 3: GitHub CLI (when on correct branch)**
```bash
# Set repository default (already done)
gh repo set-default hallucinate-llc/generative-protein-binder-design

# Run specific workflows (once merged to main)
gh workflow run system-health.yml -f deep_check=true
gh workflow run protein-design-pipeline.yml -f use_native=true -f target_protein=7BZ5
```
