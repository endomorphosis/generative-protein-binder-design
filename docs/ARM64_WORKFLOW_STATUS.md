# ARM64 Porting - Completion Status

## üéØ WORKFLOW TRIGGERED!

The ARM64 completion workflow has been successfully triggered and is now running (or queued) on your ARM64 self-hosted runner.

## What Just Happened

### Commits Made
1. **b2688f0** - Add ARM64 completion workflow and guide
   - Created `arm64-complete-port.yml` workflow
   - Added `ARM64_NEXT_STEPS.md` guide
   - Added `.workflow-trigger` file

2. **4343ab6** - Trigger ARM64 completion workflow
   - Updated trigger file to initiate workflow

### Workflow Details

**Workflow Name:** ARM64 Complete Porting Workflow
**File:** `.github/workflows/arm64-complete-port.yml`
**Trigger:** Automatic on push to `copilot/port-project-to-arm64` branch
**Runner:** `[self-hosted, ARM64, gpu]`

## Monitor Your Workflow

### Option 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)
Visit: https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/generative-protein-binder-design/actions

You should see the "ARM64 Complete Porting Workflow" running.

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# Check runner status
../scripts/check_runner_status.sh

# List recent workflow runs (requires gh CLI)
gh run list --workflow=arm64-complete-port.yml --limit 5

# Watch the latest run
gh run watch
```

## Workflow Jobs

The workflow consists of 7 jobs that run in sequence:

1. **arm64-platform-check** ‚è±Ô∏è ~1 min
   - Detects ARM64 architecture
   - Outputs platform information

2. **validate-arm64-setup** ‚è±Ô∏è ~2 min
   - Runs `verify_arm64_port.sh`
   - Runs `detect_platform.sh`
   - Validates Docker Compose files

3. **test-python-environment** ‚è±Ô∏è ~3 min
   - Sets up Python virtual environment
   - Installs requirements
   - Tests scientific packages (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)

4. **test-docker-containers** ‚è±Ô∏è ~5 min
   - Tests ARM64 native containers
   - Tests AMD64 emulation
   - Tests GPU access in containers

5. **test-native-installation** ‚è±Ô∏è ~15 min (optional)
   - Checks for Conda/Mamba
   - Tests PyTorch installation on ARM64

6. **run-protein-pipeline** ‚è±Ô∏è ~10 min (optional)
   - Creates test pipeline directory
   - Creates test protein structure
   - Tests pipeline components

7. **completion-summary** ‚è±Ô∏è ~1 min
   - Generates completion report
   - Uploads artifacts
   - Provides summary

**Total Estimated Time:** 15-40 minutes depending on options

## Expected Artifacts

When the workflow completes, you'll find artifacts in the GitHub Actions page:

1. **arm64-completion-report-{run_number}**
   - Platform information
   - Workflow results summary
   - Porting status
   - Retention: 90 days

2. **arm64-pipeline-test-{run_number}** (if pipeline runs)
   - Pipeline test results
   - Test protein structures
   - Processing logs
   - Retention: 30 days

## Success Indicators

### ‚úÖ Successful Workflow Run

You'll know the workflow succeeded when:
- All 7 jobs show green checkmarks
- Completion report shows "ARM64 porting validation successful!"
- Artifacts are available for download
- No error messages in logs

### Example Success Output:
```
ARM64 PORTING WORKFLOW COMPLETED

Jobs completed:
‚úì Platform Check: success
‚úì Validation: success
‚úì Python Environment: success
‚úì Docker Containers: success
‚úì Native Installation: success
‚úì Pipeline: success
‚úì Completion Summary: success

Status: ARM64 porting validation successful!
```

## What to Do After Workflow Completes

### 1. Download and Review Completion Report
```bash
# Using gh CLI
gh run download <run-id> --name arm64-completion-report-<run_number>
cat arm64_completion_report.txt
```

### 2. Verify Results
Check that the report shows:
- ‚úÖ Platform: ARM64 (aarch64)
- ‚úÖ All validation tests passed
- ‚úÖ Python packages work on ARM64
- ‚úÖ Docker native and emulation functional
- ‚úÖ GPU accessible

### 3. Run Full Protein Design Pipeline
```bash
# Trigger the full pipeline with real targets
gh workflow run protein-design-pipeline.yml \
  -f use_native=true \
  -f target_protein=7BZ5 \
  -f num_designs=10
```

### 4. Set Up Automated Scheduling (Optional)
Add to your workflows:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
```

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Doesn't Start
**Possible causes:**
- Runner is offline
- Workflow file has syntax errors
- Branch name mismatch

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check runner status
../scripts/check_runner_status.sh

# Validate workflow YAML
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/arm64-complete-port.yml'))"

# Check current branch
git branch
```

### Workflow Fails
**Check the logs:**
1. Go to GitHub Actions page
2. Click on the failed run
3. Click on the failed job
4. Review error messages

**Common issues:**
- Insufficient disk space
- Missing dependencies
- Network connectivity
- NGC API key not set (for NIM containers)

### Jobs Are Skipped
**This is normal!** Some jobs are optional:
- `test-native-installation` runs only if `run_validation_tests != 'false'`
- `run-protein-pipeline` runs only if `run_full_pipeline != 'false'`
