# ARM64 Porting - Next Steps Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to complete the ARM64 porting process using the GitHub Actions workflows that have been set up.

## Current Status

âœ… **COMPLETED:**
- ARM64 infrastructure set up
- All 7 workflows deployed and validated
- Documentation complete
- Verification scripts created
- ARM64 runner connected and operational

ðŸ”„ **IN PROGRESS:**
- Using workflows to complete actual porting
- Running validation tests on ARM64 hardware
- Testing end-to-end pipeline

## Automatic Workflow Execution

### New Workflow: `arm64-complete-port.yml`

A comprehensive workflow has been created that will automatically run when you push changes to this branch. It performs:

1. **Platform Detection** - Verifies ARM64 architecture
2. **Validation** - Runs all verification scripts
3. **Python Environment Testing** - Tests scientific packages on ARM64
4. **Docker Testing** - Tests both ARM64 native and AMD64 emulation
5. **Native Installation Testing** - Tests PyTorch and other native tools
6. **Pipeline Execution** - Runs protein design pipeline components
7. **Completion Report** - Generates comprehensive status report

### How to Trigger the Workflow

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
The workflow will automatically run when you push this commit:

```bash
# The workflow will trigger automatically when this branch is pushed
```

**Option 2: Manual Trigger via GitHub Web**
1. Go to: https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/generative-protein-binder-design/actions
2. Click on "ARM64 Complete Porting Workflow"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Configure options:
   - â˜‘ Run full pipeline
   - â˜‘ Run validation tests
5. Click "Run workflow"

**Option 3: Manual Trigger via Git Push**
```bash
# Make a small change to trigger the workflow
echo "Trigger ARM64 completion - $(date)" >> .workflow-trigger
git add .workflow-trigger
git commit -m "Trigger ARM64 completion workflow"
git push origin copilot/port-project-to-arm64
```

## What the Workflow Does

### 1. Platform Detection
- Detects ARM64 architecture
- Validates system configuration
- Outputs platform information for other jobs

### 2. Validation Suite
- Runs `verify_arm64_port.sh` - validates all porting changes
- Runs `detect_platform.sh` - detects and reports platform details
- Validates Docker Compose configurations

### 3. Python Environment Testing
- Sets up Python virtual environment on ARM64
- Installs all requirements
- Tests key scientific packages:
  - Jupyter
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Requests

### 4. Docker Container Testing
- **ARM64 Native Containers:**
  - Tests Ubuntu ARM64 container
  - Verifies native ARM64 execution
  
- **AMD64 Emulation:**
  - Sets up QEMU emulation
  - Tests Ubuntu AMD64 container
  - Verifies Python installation in emulated container
  
- **GPU Access:**
  - Tests GPU passthrough to containers
  - Validates NVIDIA Container Runtime

### 5. Native Installation Testing
- Checks for Conda/Mamba installation
- Tests PyTorch installation on ARM64
- Validates ARM64-native package availability

### 6. Pipeline Component Testing
- Creates test protein structure
- Tests file processing
- Validates pipeline directory structure
- Generates test outputs

### 7. Completion Report
- Summarizes all test results
- Provides platform information
- Indicates porting status
- Uploaded as workflow artifact

## Monitoring Workflow Execution

### Via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to: https://github.com/hallucinate-llc/generative-protein-binder-design/actions
2. Click on the latest workflow run
3. Monitor each job in real-time
4. View logs for detailed information

### Via Command Line
```bash
# Check runner status
../scripts/check_runner_status.sh

# View workflow runs (requires gh CLI)
gh run list --workflow=arm64-complete-port.yml

# View specific run details
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

## Artifacts Generated

Each workflow run generates artifacts:

1. **arm64-completion-report-{run_number}**
   - Platform information
   - Test results summary
   - Porting status
   - Recommendations

2. **arm64-pipeline-test-{run_number}** (if pipeline runs)
   - Pipeline test results
   - Test protein structures
   - Processing logs

Download artifacts from:
- GitHub Actions web interface
- Via `gh run download <run-id>`

## Expected Results

### Successful Execution

When the workflow completes successfully, you should see:

```
ARM64 PORTING WORKFLOW COMPLETED

Jobs completed:
âœ“ Platform Check: success
âœ“ Validation: success
âœ“ Python Environment: success
âœ“ Docker Containers: success
âœ“ Native Installation: success (or skipped)
âœ“ Pipeline: success (or skipped)
âœ“ Completion Summary: success

Status: ARM64 porting validation successful!
```

### What Success Means

- âœ… ARM64 platform confirmed
- âœ… All verification scripts pass
- âœ… Docker Compose configurations valid
- âœ… Python packages work on ARM64
- âœ… ARM64 containers run natively
- âœ… AMD64 emulation functional
- âœ… GPU accessible from containers
- âœ… Pipeline components operational

## Next Steps After Workflow Completion

### 1. Review Completion Report
```bash
# Download the latest completion report
gh run download --name arm64-completion-report-<run_number>
cat arm64_completion_report.txt
```

### 2. Run Full Protein Design Pipeline
```bash
# Manually trigger the full pipeline workflow
gh workflow run protein-design-pipeline.yml \
  -f use_native=true \
  -f target_protein=7BZ5 \
  -f num_designs=10
```

### 3. Test with Real Data
- Use actual protein targets (PDB IDs)
- Run complete binder design workflow
- Validate outputs and performance

### 4. Set Up Automated Scheduling
Add to any workflow file:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
```

### 5. Monitor Performance
- Compare ARM64 vs AMD64 performance
- Benchmark native vs emulated execution
- Optimize resource allocation

## Troubleshooting

### Workflow Doesn't Start
- Check runner is online: `../scripts/check_runner_status.sh`
- Verify branch name matches: `copilot/port-project-to-arm64`
- Check workflow file syntax: `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/arm64-complete-port.yml'))"`

### Jobs Fail
- Review job logs in GitHub Actions web interface
- Check runner resources (memory, disk space)
- Verify NGC API keys if using NIM containers
- Ensure GPU drivers are up to date

### Artifacts Not Generated
- Check job completed successfully
- Artifacts have 30-90 day retention
- Download before expiration

## Additional Workflows Available

Run these workflows individually for specific testing:

1. **System Health Check**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run system-health.yml -f deep_check=true
   ```

2. **ARM64 Validation**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run arm64-validation.yml -f test_mode=full
   ```

3. **Docker Compatibility**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run docker-test.yml -f platform=both
   ```

4. **Native Installation**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run native-install-test.yml -f component=all
   ```

5. **Jupyter Notebooks**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run jupyter-test.yml
   ```

## Success Criteria
