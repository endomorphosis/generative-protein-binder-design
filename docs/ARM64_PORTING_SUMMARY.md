## Deployment Options on ARM64

### Option A: Docker with Emulation
- **Setup Time:** Minutes
- **Performance:** Moderate (emulation overhead)
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Recommended For:** Testing, evaluation, quick start

### Option B: Native Installation
- **Setup Time:** Days
- **Performance:** High (no emulation)
- **Complexity:** High
- **Recommended For:** Production, long-term deployment

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- **Setup Time:** Hours to days
- **Performance:** High for critical components
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Recommended For:** Balanced performance and convenience

## Testing Strategy

### Workflow-Based Testing

1. **Platform Validation:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run arm64-validation.yml -f test_mode=full
   ```

2. **Component Testing:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run docker-test.yml -f platform=both
   gh workflow run native-install-test.yml -f component=all
   gh workflow run jupyter-test.yml
   ```

3. **Pipeline Testing:**
   ```bash
   gh workflow run protein-design-pipeline.yml -f use_native=true
   ```

### Local Testing

1. **Platform Detection:**
   ```bash
   ../scripts/detect_platform.sh
   ```

2. **Docker Validation:**
   ```bash
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose.yaml config
   docker compose -f deploy/docker-compose-single-gpu.yaml config
   ```

3. **YAML Validation:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('.github/workflows/arm64-validation.yml'))"
   ```

## Known Limitations

### AMD64 Containers on ARM64

1. **Performance Impact:**
   - 20-50% slower execution due to emulation
   - Higher memory usage (10-20% more)
   - Increased container startup time

2. **Compatibility:**
   - Most containers work with emulation
   - Some low-level operations may fail
   - GPU passthrough works but with overhead

3. **Resource Usage:**
   - CPU emulation adds overhead
   - Memory requirements increase
   - Storage I/O may be impacted

### NVIDIA NIM Containers

1. **Architecture:**
   - Built exclusively for AMD64/x86_64
   - No native ARM64 versions available
   - Must use emulation on ARM64 hosts

2. **Alternatives:**
   - Native installation of underlying tools
   - Custom ARM64 container builds
   - Hybrid deployment approach

## Performance Considerations

### Benchmarking Results (Expected)

On ARM64 vs AMD64:
- **Native ARM64 tools:** Equal or better performance
- **Emulated AMD64 containers:** 30-50% slower
- **Hybrid approach:** 10-20% slower overall
- **Memory usage:** 10-20% higher with emulation

### Optimization Tips

1. **Use native ARM64 packages where possible**
2. **Cache Docker images to reduce pull time**
3. **Increase memory allocation for emulated containers**
4. **Monitor GPU usage to identify bottlenecks**
5. **Use multi-stage Docker builds to minimize image size**

## Troubleshooting
